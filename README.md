## About the Fibonacci Series

The Fibonacci sequence is a famous mathematical sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. It starts with 0 and 1, and the sequence continues infinitely. Mathematically, it can be defined as:
F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

This sequence has many fascinating applications in various fields, from mathematics to biology and art.

## Code Explanation

This C++ program calculates and displays the term in the Fibonacci sequence at a desired position using a recursive function. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

- The `fibonacci` function takes an integer `n` as input, representing the position in the sequence.
- If `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `n` (base cases).
- Otherwise, it recursively calls itself to calculate the Fibonacci number at position `n` as the sum of the numbers at positions `n-1` and `n-2`.
- The main function takes user input for the position and then prints the result.
